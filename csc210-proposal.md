Project Proposal - LongWing

This web application is mainly aimed to match people who would like to lend their cars and people who want to rent a car. Right now people always rent a car from some of the biggest car rental company such as hertz, enterprice, etc, but the price is relatively high and car rental is subject to lots of regulations and rules. By using this web application, we divide people into two parts: lenders and borrowers. Lenders can lend their idle cars to others and earn payments, while borrowers can borrow cars on an agreement with lenders. This gives both sides more flexibility as of rent time and rent price. 
Lenders will post their car's available time and minimum prices they accept per day. Borrowers search for cars like searching for a hotel. They enter the time they need car, the city they need the car, and maybe the possible miles they are going to travel. Then we return to the customers the available cars at according time periods along with the price. Once the borrower make a choice, the match in complete. Borrowers and lenders can talk in private to discuss any detailed issues (such as discount, pick up, etc).

Target Audience:
The target audience is for people who want to lend their idle cars and people who want to rent a car with a low price and with enough flexibility.

Problem to solve:

For people who rent cars:
The price is relative low, because price negotiation is always possible. 
Furthermore, people who want to travel and rent the car can always find cars with special preference.
The car rental time can be more flexible, unlike car rental companies.
For people who lend cars:
They can earn money with their idle cars and make more friends.

Minimum project requirements:
All minimum requirements are met - create, read, update, delete, Ajax.

Uniqueness and Creativity:
Besides minimum requirements, we may also implement the Google map Application in order to help people locate available cars in different places.
